## Required Functionality

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [x] Game interface has a heading (h1 tag), a line of body text (p tag), and four buttons that match the demo app
* [x] "Start" button toggles between "Start" and "Stop" when clicked. 
* [x] Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked. 
* [x] Computer plays back sequence of clues including sound and visual cue for each button
* [x] Play progresses to the next turn (the user gets the next step in the pattern) after a correct guess. 
* [x] User wins the game after guessing a complete pattern
* [x] User loses the game after an incorrect guess

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [x] Any HTML page elements (including game buttons) has been styled differently than in the tutorial
* [x] Buttons use a pitch (frequency) other than the ones in the tutorial
* [ ] More than 4 functional game buttons
* [ ] Playback speeds up on each turn
* [ ] Computer picks a different pattern each time the game is played
* [x] Player only loses after 3 mistakes (instead of on the first mistake)
* [ ] Game button appearance change goes beyond color (e.g. add an image)
* [ ] Game button sound is more complex than a single tone (e.g. an audio file, a chord, a sequence of multiple tones)
* [ ] User has a limited amount of time to enter their guess on each turn

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app!

## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here.

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
While I was working on the project, there was one difficult problem that I encountered. 
It was the part where I was required to write the logic to make the code run in the 
JavaScript file. Since there were no step by step instructions here anymore like other 
parts, it took me a while to move on from there. I understood the logic and the flow chart.
However, I was not so confident with the language enough to express my ideas. I tried to
test my code out anyway. Unfortunately, my code did not work correctly. It was full of 
bugs, and the game did not respond at all. That was when I realized I did not comprehend 
all the provided functions like I thought. Thus, I started reading the project all over 
again. This time I made sure I completely understood what a function does before I move 
on the next one. I read more carefully and try to explain what I understood to myself. 
Then I came back to the process and wrote a pseudo code using the flowchart. After that,
I compare my code with the provided solution and revise it. At the end, I learned that 
I should make sure that I am familiar with all the given functions, so I will not have a 
hard time trying to solve the challenge again.


3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
After finishing the project, I have numerous questions about web development. First
of all, I wonder how I would be able to use databases such as MongoDB to expand the
project. For instance, I want to have a database to store the players' score and time,
so the programmers can study people's memorizing ability. Other than that, I wonder 
how RESTful API would be applied in web development. For example, if I want to call an 
application or some kind of services to use in my web app, how would I do it? Last but 
least, I wonder how the web developers would still be needed when there are a lot of 
website builders out there, and those web builders get improved everyday. What if the 
web builders can also support the dynamic logic to the website?

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
I have so many ideas that I wanted to work on if I had more time on this project. First,
I want to make a leaderboard. To do that, I think I would have to add the feature that
can time the players and a basic database to store the result and display the best one. 
Second, I want to create a level of hardness. The players can choose the number of buttons
and the speed they want to play. Other than that, I also want to create a feature which
will let the players choose the theme of colors they want to see on display.
